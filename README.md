# linear-regression-grades
Predicts students' final grades using linear regression model
train_test_split is for splitting data arrays into two subsets: for training data and for testing data
To find out how well does hypotheses predict G3 on new data sets we use test. Method predict() predicts what are G3 values using X_test features and my hypothese. 
predictions[x] is machine's prediction based on X_test features(attributes) and hypotheses({linear}). y_test[x] are actual values of G3
